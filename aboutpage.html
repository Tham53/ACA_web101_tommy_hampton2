<li>
When I'm not building websites, I can usuaally be found at a Toastmasters meeting.
I love public speaking, throughout the course of my life I've gathered hundreds of
personal stories, some hillarious, some tragic. Toastmasters provides me with an outlet
for personal expression. Although many people use the organization to improve presentation
skills for their careers.
